# APIMiniProject



<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<h3>Aim</h3>

The aim of the project is to create a framework to interact with the 'todolist' API (https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#developing-with-todoist) and run extensive tests on the API endpoints to evaluate the responses.

<h3>API</h3>

The API allows you to create a to-do list by defining a project and then assigning tasks to it. It enables the user to apply CRUD functionality to these projects with endpoints containing a multitude of optional parameters. <b>More stuff at some point</b>
