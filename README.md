# API Mini Project



<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<h3>Aim</h3>

The aim of the project is to create a framework to interact with the 'todolist' REST API (https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#developing-with-todoist) and run extensive tests on the API endpoints to evaluate the responses.

<h3>API</h3>

The API allows you to create a to-do list by defining a project and then assigning tasks to it. It enables the user to apply CRUD functionality to these projects with endpoints containing a multitude of optional parameters. <b>More stuff at some point</b>
<p> The API can create projects where you can name them and then specify their colour, if they are in favourites, whether they have been shared and more. Within projects you can create tasks. Tasks have their own name (content) and can also contain more detail such as the assigner, whether its completed, the due date and more. </p> 

<h3>Class Diagram</h3>

<b>Insert class diagram here.</b>

<h3>Services and Managers</h3>

<p>All the requests require a user token for authentication. </p>

<b>Something about the structure of how we access the API</b>

<h3>Unit Testing</h3>

<b>Something about how we evaluate the response and what we are looking to achieve with the tests</b>

 <p>API testing is intended to reveal bugs: inconsistencies or deviations from the expected behavior.</p>
 <p>Using software to send calls to the API, get output, and log the systemâ€™s response.</p>
